## Workflow repository targeting

`.github/issue-management/github.mjs:repositoryTarget` resolves GitHub API requests to the repository that launched the workflow when `DSH_ISSUE_REPOSITORY` is present; local policy tests retain the canonical project fallback. Automated pull requests do not need Project lifecycle work or Cloudflare previews, so the corresponding workflows skip those external integrations for bot-authored pull requests.

Reference: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:node` and `scripts/ci-workflow.spec.ts:workflow`. Pull-request Linux and Windows lanes use standard GitHub-hosted runners by default; `DSH_CI_FAILOVER_LINUX`, `DSH_CI_FAILOVER_WINDOWS`, and their explicit Blacksmith or self-hosted values retain the opt-in alternatives.

Reference: `packages/api/settings-controller/src/request.ts:settingsRequest.parse`. Authorization and credential request validation share one parser so the duplication gate does not accept two copies of the same wire-error mapping.
